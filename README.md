## Lab Questions

From this lab, We learned how edge triggering changes the behavior of latches. 
We also learned how the JK flip flop may be a nuniveral application that can be used as a d flip flop and a t flip flop

### What is different between edge and level sensitive circuits?

Edge sensitivity allows data to pass through only when clock changes. 
Level sensitivity allows data to pass through as long as clock is active.

### Why is it important to declare initial state?

An initial state is important to declare because if it wasn't declared, the board would have no way of knowing what the data should be. 
It needs to be declared so that unpredictable behaviors do not occur

### What do edge sensitive circuits let us build?

Edge sensitive circuits open up the possibility to build many circuits. For example, edge sensitive circuits are necessary or memory systems and if you wanted to build a circuit that counted each time you pressed a button.
